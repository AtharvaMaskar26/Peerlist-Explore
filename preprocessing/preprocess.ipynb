It provides an interactive platform that allows users to track and verify the history of a product, from the time it was manufactured to when it was shipped. With Provenance, you can have confidence in your purchasing decisions, knowing that the product you're buying is genuine.The platform's most distinctive aspect is its ability to ensure secure and efficient supply chain operations over Proof of Benefit (PoB) consensus. The smart contracts handle these operations, and the integration of QR code-based product verification streamlines the process.\",\n",

This lets you pave a foundational path towards quicker promotion and higher compensation.  Problem Early in our careers, my cofounder Alex and I learned that being a good coder does NOT translate to being a good software engineer. There’s a huge gap between the skills taught in school and the skills necessary to be a talented engineer. These skills evolve as you go from junior to mid-level to senior engineer. If you don’t get lucky with a good mentor or friend, you’ll miss the “insider” perspective on career success. For example: how do you build trust with your manager, find a promising team, and manage your time appropriately? Especially in a post-pandemic world, where many of us are remote or hybrid, it’s hard to find quick, informal mentorship. And this isolation is particularly stark for women and under-represented minorities, who leave the tech industry at a 45% higher rate.  Solution Taro delivers valuable content for software engineers, personalized by level and company. We also offer a premium program for full access to the membership program: compensation tips, invitations to exclusive events, and responses from career mentors. All of this is available at a tiny fraction of the cost of a traditional career coach, and we’ve heard Taro is more valuable than any coach due to the community behind it. Think of Taro like Blind without the toxic negativity  and like LinkedIn without the toxic positivity More than 25,000 software engineers visit joinTaro.com each month, and we have hundreds of Taro Premium members. We are available on web (joinTaro.com), as well as an Android + iOS app. Thank you for checking us out!',\n",

We have made an **WebApplication** to improve the communication gap between tiffin service and customers.

We researched if any similar kind of platform exists in the market already or not. And we couldn't find any existing platform solving this problem, so we designed our own new type of process flow from build customer as well as Service Provider panel where customer can buy fixed lunch, dinner from different tiffin services and schedule his/her service on a subscription. Challenges we ran into while Implementing ?  We faced a lot of challenges while implementation. Firstly, we had some issues while playing with the css in the frontend. After that we faced a problem in authorisation of the service provider and the customer.  Accomplishments that we're proud of ?  We successfully participated in our first ever hackathon and we tried our 100% and enjoyed the process of learning. We explored many tech products from our sponsers like storyblok, Zeeve, Apyhub, Postman, etc. Also first time in our life we haven't slept all night as we were enjoying the hacking phase, that's also a small achievement.  What we learned ?  We learned teamwork, collaboration with other Hackers, and how to manage work in less time.  What's next for Tservice ?  We are planing to complete add features like user rating, payment gateway, and host in a proper way so that we can make this webApp release in public. We will connect few nearby tiffin service to shift to online platform like us and increase their clients and help the ones in need.  \",\n",

       "  'description': \"## InspirationPeople with disabilities and language barriers often face challenges in conversation. For individuals with disabilities, physical or communication limitations can make it difficult to express themselves effectively. For those with language barriers, they may struggle to understand the conversation or be understood by others. These challenges can lead to feelings of isolation and frustration, as well as misunderstandings and missed opportunities. To address these issues, it is important to create an inclusive and supportive environment where individuals feel comfortable and able to participate fully in conversations. We need assistive technologies to help people in this regards.## What it doesThe idea is to create a mobile application which people can use to conduct their conversations which has voice-to-text, text-to-speech, voice translations and text translations inbuilt to facilitate smoother conversations so that people can actually focus on the conversation instead of worrying about such barriers.## How we built itThe mobile application is made Flutter and uses socket.io to handle messages with the backend which is made using Nest.js, Prisma ORM, GraphQL, Socket.io, MongoDB, Azure Cognitive Language service and deployed on Azure.## Challenges we ran intoWhile building this app we knew that we will have to communicate using WebSockets and that too not normally we had to build custom and efficient WebSockets and also that could work for the language conversion. Another challenge was to test these WebSockets where we learned more in-depth about Postman and how to test WebSockets using that. After that integrating those Web Sockets into the Flutter framework and building a user-friendly UI was a very big and hectic task.## Accomplishments that we're proud ofWe are proud to say that we successfully build the complete application and overcame all the challenges we had while building this revolutionary app. We understood a lot about Azure and the amazing services it provides, and we understood a lot in depth about Postman and created a very good API and Socket Workspace Documentation. Building this whole Application's Prototype was a very big accomplishment for me and my team.## What we learnedWe learned a lot about architecture and building Web Sockets and Gateways for an application at the backend in NestJS. We understood graphql and made its APIs, we also learned about Azure and the Cognitive Language Service it provides. Also, we got to know how to integrate these Web Sockets into Flutter Frontend Application.## What's next for RelayThis can be extended to one-to-many or many-to-many conversations like speeches, online chatting, live events like workshops, and events with people of multiple nationalities. This will give more chances for people with disabilities to attend such events without fear. They can pay more attention to the actual content of discussions instead of worrying about their disabilities in understanding, conveying, and being themselves and proudly taking part in conversations. We also aim to introduce an IoT solution that can help disabled people more and increase the comfort of our user base.\",\n",

I began by signing up for various tools and testing them out, saving the best ones for myself to refer to later. As I continued my search, I realized that many people were also struggling to find and try the best and newest apps available on the internet.To help others, I decided to create a comprehensive resource that would list all of these apps in one place. However, as a designer without coding skills, maintaining and updating a website with time and effort constraints was challenging. So, I started posting my findings on a Telegram channel for a year or so (I still do this for blogs, app deals, and more).Eventually, I discovered bento.me, which allowed me to create a page with hundreds of apps listed in one place.

With Constellation, you can do everything from data visualization w/ dynamic graphs to one-click deployments in one place.What are the features?Data Visualization of your CSVs without needing to write codeExtensive workspace, project, and experiment management for better collaborationDrag and drop UI to quickly build ML pipelinesAutoML support if you are too lazy.Pipeline verification and code generationOne-line training powered by in-house SDK. All metrics and results directly visible on the platformEasily compare different experiments by creating easily customizable dashboards with report generation support.Inference pipeline generation and one-click deploymentsDeployment monitoring by using Prometheus. So basically, is it a low-code/no-code platform?Yes but the major disadvantage of general low-code platforms is no support for custom logic and code editing. The code generation method we use enables developer to inject their logic in the pipelines we generate. You get a file, you can edit it, run it or write your code and use our platform for other features.Where can we try it out?At this stage, we are wrapping up most of the features to prepare a BETA soon. Until then, check out this image out for a good tease, you can connect with me here and be updated :)\",\n",

The platform provides detailed job descriptions to ensure the best experience for all users.As a solo-founder, I am facing many challenges, including building a user-friendly platform and acquiring new users in a highly competitive market. I am overcoming these obstacles by listening to user feedback and continuously improving the platform to meet their needs.I have faith in the product.

This was done to have a visual representation of the project and to validate the design before proceeding to the implementation stage.After the prototype was created, the team moved to the Frontend and Backend development. For the Frontend, they used a combination of technologies including ejs (Embedded JavaScript), css (Cascading Style Sheets), and tailwind (a utility-first CSS framework). This combination of technologies allowed the team to create a visually appealing and interactive user interface.The Backend of KnowledgeKnights was built using Node.js, a JavaScript runtime environment, and Express.js, a popular web framework for Node.js. The team also used Twilio-OTP Service to handle one-time password (OTP) verification and edu email verification using ApyHub API Integration for security purposes. The data for the application was stored in a MongoDB database, which is a NoSQL database management system.In conclusion, the development of KnowledgeKnights was done using a combination of Frontend and Backend technologies, which allowed the team to create a functional and visually appealing application.',\n",

Capex's for a layman basically means that a particular company is expanding its current capacity . If earlier an company could produce 100 Pencils Per day and they expanded capacity and now are able to produce 150 Pencils Per Day You see ? This sort of information is extremely valuable for Investors like me . And when i was at the other side of the product (Consumer) i found nobody doing this at all . The ones which were doing it only had limit data points .So i decided to solve this problem myself and started learning Bubble.io and python programming language . Within 4 Months of building an MVP I finally launched Shodh publicly in April . - Since the first day of Building Shodh i have been building it in public and still doing it on Twitter . - Since then Shodh has got lifetime traffic of more than 1.3 Lakh and 4.2 K Registered Investors   Since the launch Shodh has launched much more features than just Capex's , which are - 1. Corporate Announcements 2. Personalized Feed 3. Events Calendar 4. Notes 5. Save / Bookmarks . Shodh is an power-packed Stock research platform now + With Great User Interface and Experience .

I developed PomoGuru because I was struggling to stay focused and productive during my work and study sessions. I tried a lot of different productivity apps, but I found most of them too cluttered and distracting. That's why I decided to create PomoGuru - a simple, minimalistic app based on the Pomodoro technique.One of our main goals with PomoGuru was to create an ad-free experience that users could rely on to help them stay on task. We know how annoying it can be to be constantly bombarded with ads, so we made sure to keep PomoGuru completely free of them.But beyond being ad-free, what really sets PomoGuru apart is its focus on maximizing productivity. We designed the app to make it easy for users to get started with the Pomodoro technique - just set a timer for 25 minutes of work and 5 minutes of break, and let PomoGuru handle the rest. We've also included some great features to help users stay on track, such as task lists and progress tracking.As someone who's struggled with productivity in the past, I'm really proud of what we've created with PomoGuru. And I hope that it can help others like me to be more focused, motivated, and productive in their work and studies. So give it a try, and let us know what you think!\",\n",

We came up with a special solution for this. Cryptons will convert your token into a single multi-claimable coupon / multiple coupons of the specified value, together with an easily shareable link and QR code. With getting\\xa0rid of\\xa0the necessity for the sender to batch many transactions, we make it simple for any user to submit a gasless claim with just one click.The coupon code are completely private, as they are custom generated based on user given alpha numeric string, getting hased by SHA256. Only the hashed coupon code is getting stored for associating the value of coupon, no centralised storage for coupon codes and a set validity of coupons, after which the issuer can reclaim the tokens if it reamined unclaimed, Also we're perfoming multiple checks to not overdistribute multiple claims to single user, by using multiple checks by frontend, api, and on contect view functions.So we're releaving the burden of the sender and making it convienient for recievers as well, as they can claim it to their desired wallet without paying any gas fees.\",\n",

It's been a long time coming, and I'm excited to share my journey with all of you. Beginning of this year, and I knew it was time to take action. I had to find a website builder that would let me create a custom site without compromising on design, and Framer happened. It's a game-changer, and I could finally bring all my design dreams to life without writing a single line of code. Except for a few extra delight details which needed custom code and ChatGPT came to my rescue. What a time to be alive!Of course, like any project, I had to drag myself through the initial stages. But then as soon as it clicked, the excitement kicked in and there was no stopping. It's a work in progress, I have plans for my brand and I will be updating frequently and building in public. I’ll continue adding my other interests and keep this more than just a portfolio or about design. Finally, if you've made it this far, THANK YOU!\",\n",

I like to build products that intend to create impact and makes people's life easier. I've been building various products over the last couple of years, but this is the best one yet. I had this new year resolution to build and launch something great this year, but didn't know what it was. As i was pondering on what it could be i was also learning about indie SaaS projects, so i decided that i could build something of my own and took it up as a challenge to build one in 28 days starting Feb 1. But as software takes time, It took me until mid of April to have an MVP of sorts.  I've took some help from my father to host it on digital ocean, and I am committed to myself that I will push through to sell this to potential customers. I am in no way a designer and have done my best to make the site look not bad. But there is still miles to go on the design front. Anyhow, I expect honest feedback and suggestions to make this product better and successful. its live at unoForms.xyz \",\n",

       "  'description': 'For this project, I analysed a dataset provided by Rotten Tomatoes, which consisted of ratings and reviews of more than 15,000 movies that had been reviewed by the website Rotten tomatoes\\xa0(source: Kaggle). Each record contains information about the movie (title, synopsis, rating, genre, cast, directors, studio, runtime, etc.), along with highlighted reviews, \"Tomatometer\" status, and audience ratings.  The \"Tomatometer\" status is a unique feature of Rotten Tomatoes, which is a rating system that aggregates the reviews of professional critics to produce a score representing the percentage of positive reviews. The audience ratings, on the other hand, represent the average rating given by the general public. With this information, it is possible to conduct various analyses on the dataset. The dataset consist of 16,614 rows and 17 columns. Overall, the dataset provides a rich and diverse collection of information about movies that can be used to explore various recommended analysis questions, such as the relationship between ratings and box office success, the impact of different genres on ratings, and the influence of cast and directors on movie ratings. The dataset also provides opportunities for developing predictive models to forecast the success of a movie based on its details and ratings.RECOMMENDED ANALYSIS ON THE DATASET :What does the distribution of films look like by rating? By primary genre? What % of films received a Certified Fresh Tomatometer rating? What about Rotten?Explore new film releases over time. How has the volume of releases by month trended over time? What year/month were the most new films released?Compare average Tomatometer ratings by Studio. Which studios produce the highest rated films, on average? The lowest?Compare the Tomatometer ratings against audience ratings. Which films showed the largest discrepancies between audiences and critics?Explore the critics consensus rating: what language is used most often?CONCLUSION :The dataset provides a wealth of information that can be used to gain insights into the movie industry, and to develop predictive charts that can inform decision-making in the field. Therefore, the findings of such an analysis can have important implications for the movie industry and help inform decision-making related to movie production, marketing, and distribution.',\n",

It's a great way to learn, test and showcase your knowledge on the latest happenings in tech.BackstoryThe idea behind TGIF was simple: we wanted to engage people who are interested in tech, products and design. This is a broad audience: ranging from professionals, to students, as also enthusiasts.We already have initiatives that are meant to engage people getting into design or product management: Weekly Challenges, UX Hackathons, Hiring Hackathons. Each of these needs a certain depth and interest in the topics, which meant that they weren't for everyone. There was also a time constraint.At the same time we had a lot people who loved UXHack for what it is. They loved the challenges, the concept of hacking out solutions, but never had a meaningful way of engaging with us or reason to join our community.Finally the tech and product space is probably one of the most exciting ones out there, with something new happening everyday (I'd say Financial markets and politics come close 2nd and 3rd).So, to us, it was all about combining these elements to come up with something that appealed to this wider audience, yet was challenging and interesting. Moreover, we wanted the ethos to be grounded in products, UX and design.And so that led us to TGIF. A new quiz every Friday at 8 PM India time.Play the current and old quiz here\",\n",

Based on the forecasted prices and the budget allocated for that particular period, the business can plan for the procurement of the raw material.3 Overlapping ObservationOverlapping of raw materials in the price chart does not necessarily mean that the requirement for all materials is the same throughout the year. Each raw material has its unique demand and supply factors that affect its price, and the demand for different materials can vary depending on various factors such as seasonal changes, industry trends, and market conditions.For example, the demand for cotton may be higher during the summer months when clothing production increases, while the demand for rubber may be higher during the rainy season when there is an increased need for tires and other rubber products. Similarly, the demand for wood products may be higher during the construction season, while the demand for animal hides may be higher during the winter months when the demand for leather products increases.Therefore, it is important to analyze the demand and supply factors for each raw material separately to understand its unique requirements and forecast its future prices accordingly. This information can help businesses make informed decisions about their procurement and production strategies and ensure that they have sufficient raw materials to meet their production needs.THANK YOU FOR VISITINGPlease share your thoughts, it will be helpful for me',\n",

The analysis is based on historical data collected from the Google Play store, spanning from June 2012 to February 2019. By examining this dataset, we can gain a deeper understanding of various aspects related to mobile apps, including their availability, usability, and users' expectations.The dataset includes essential information such as the names of mobile apps available on the Google Play store, their corresponding categories, supported Android versions, user ratings, number of reviews, number of installs, app size, last update date, and the current version of the mobile apps.\\xa0SolutionUpon reviewing the dataset, it is apparent that there are several issues present, including blank fields and NaN (Not a Number) values. Consequently, it is necessary to address these problems by implementing suitable functions or methods to handle missing or incomplete data. By doing so, we can ensure the accuracy and reliability of our analysis.Methodology & Project scopeThe primary objective of this project is to generate a final dataset that is both calculated and presented in a manner that is easy to comprehend. This emphasis on clarity and simplicity ensures that the insights derived from the analysis are accessible and actionable. By achieving this vision, the project aims to provide valuable information and facilitate informed decision-making in the realm of mobile app business approaches and development.\\xa0The initial step of the analysis involves examining the dataset for any blank columns, ensuring that all required information is present. Subsequently, special attention is given to handling NaN values specifically in the rating column. To address this issue, the dataset can be processed using the VLOOKUP formula, which allows for substituting the missing values with appropriate ratings.Once the NaN values in the rating column have been handled, the next step is to utilize a pivot table. This pivot table analysis helps to identify patterns and extract meaningful insights from the dataset. By exploring the data through different dimensions and aggregations, it becomes possible to uncover recommended actions or strategies based on the observed trends and patterns.In summary, the process involves checking for blanks, handling NaN values using the VLOOKUP formula, and utilizing pivot tables to derive valuable recommendations and insights from the dataset.Goals & KPIsGoal 1: Enhance the comprehensibility of the data by presenting it in a clear and easily understandable format.Goal 2: Utilize pivot tables to create structured data that enables effective visualization and facilitates the generation of insightful findings.Goal 3: Providing valuable insights and actionable recommendations.\\xa0Concepts UsedConcept 1: VLOOKUP , AverageConcept 2: PIVOT TABLE , charts , GraphsConcept 3: Macros, VB, Filters , Dealing with Nan values\\xa0ConclusionIn conclusion, the primary goal of this project is to generate a final dataset that is calculated and presented in a clear and comprehensible manner. By addressing blank columns and handling NaN values, we ensure the accuracy and completeness of the data. The utilization of pivot tables further enables us to extract valuable insights, identify patterns, and make informed recommendations for mobile app business approaches and development. Through this process, we aim to provide valuable information that can facilitate decision-making in the mobile app industry.Project By,-Manoj Raut.\",\n",

Please feel free to report a bug, discuss the current state, submit ideas for improvements, submit a fix, propose new features, or whatever you want. All contributions are welcome!If you love this template and/or use it, please give it a star on GitHub. This will help more people discover it, thus help improving the template.Note: This project is always evolving and it\\'s far from being perfect or even done. I\\'m always open to suggestions and contributions. Feel free to open an issue or a PR if you have any ideas or suggestions. You can also see the [roadmap](#features--roadmap) for planned features if you want to contribute.## MotivationAs a developer who creates content, I want to have a blog & digital garden where I can share my thoughts and ideas with the world. Now, there\\'s not really a \"perfect solution\" for this currently. With included analytics, SEO, email subscriptions, modern tooling, simple design, etc. We either have to build one from scratch, use a design template and code the features, or use a CMS/no-code tool.So I decided to build a solution that I would use myself. This is the result.## Getting StartedIf you want to see how I set up this template for my own digital garden, you can check out [this commit](https://github.com/thedevdavid/website-2023/commit/fb10942d424a1389f9c4c1605849e45ff718656d) with all the changes.1. Use the repo as a template2. Install dependencies with `pnpm install`3. Edit `utils/metadata.ts` with your information4. Edit `utils/usesData.ts` with your information5. Edit `utils/projectsData.ts` with your information6. Edit `content/pages/now` with your information7. Edit `content/pages/about` with your information8. Run the development server with `pnpm dev`Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to see the result.### Writing contentYou can write content in Markdown or MDX. The content is located in `content/` and is organized in folders. The `pages` folder contains the pages. The `posts` folder contains the blogposts. The `projects` folder contains the projects.Editing list pages is done in the `lib` folder.- `/uses` - `lib/uses-data.ts`- `/projects` - `lib/projects-data.ts`- `/social` - `lib/social-data.ts`### DeploymentYou can deploy the project with [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) or any other hosting provider. If you want to use Vercel, you can use the button at the top of this README.1. Update `package.json` author information2. Set up the `NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL` environment variable on Vercel to point to your website\\'s root URL3. Build and deploy## Customization### FontsThis project uses [Inter](https://rsms.me/inter/) as the default font. You can change it on `app/layout.tsx` using the `next/fonts` package.### ColorsThe project uses Tailwind colors and @shadcn/ui config. Customize the colors on `globals.css`.### MetadataYou can change the metadata in `utils/metadata.ts`. This will be used around the site for titles, social links, social handles, SEO, etc.You can edit navigation links in `lib/navigation-links.ts`.### AnalyticsVercel analytics is added. To configure, you need to enable it on [Vercel project dashboard](https://vercel.com/dashboard) by selecting your Project and then click the Analytics tab and click Enable from the dialog.Supporting other analytics providers are planned. Feel free to open an issue if you have any suggestions or a PR if you want to implement it yourself.### Newsletter subscriptionWIP as I\\'m still deciding which email tools to support. Feel free to open an issue if you have any suggestions or a PR if you want to implement it yourself.### Hero sectionYou can choose between 3 different hero variants to use in `app/(site)/page.tsx` by changing the imported hero component.1. `HeroSimple` - A simple centered hero section with image, title, socials, and subtitle.2. `HeroVideo` - 2 column hero section with Videoask embed on one side and title and subtitle on the other.3. `HeroImage` - 2 column hero section with image on one side and title, socials, and subtitle on the other.### Other tips & tricks#### Image optimizationOptimize images in seconds for free with ImageOptim. Install on your Mac, then open the `public` folder in Finder. Select all images, right-click, and choose \"Open with > ImageOptim\". This will optimize all images in the folder.Note: DO NOT overdo it. You can easily make images look bad with lossy compression algorithms.## Examples- [https://davidlevai.com/](https://davidlevai.com/)Create a PR and add your blog to this list if you\\'re using the template!',\n",

I am thrilled to announce the launch of my latest project, UXGears.comHaving started my design career 7 years ago, I have witnessed firsthand the profound impact of UX design on organisations and their products. Whether it be startups, scale-ups, or enterprises, UX acts as a magical gear within the complex machinery of these organisations.Sometimes this gear is so small that it feels nearly invisible, but at other times, it is incredibly huge, spinning countless other gears around it. Regardless of its size, it plays a vital role in maintaining order and propelling the entire engine forward.That's precisely why I created UXGears, a comprehensive repository of design resources that will elevate your UX game.UXGears boasts an extensive collection of 525 links, encompassing UI UX tools, Illustrations, Typography, useful Chrome extensions, and much more. These resources are actively monitored and regularly updated with the latest tools and guides. I will keep you informed about new developments and features of UXGears.I hope you all find UXGears immensely valuable, and I encourage you to provide any feedback about the website.Now go ahead and discover the perfect gears for your journey.  https://www.uxgears.com/  #uxdesign #projectBest,Steve\",\n",

I did not understand this then and argued my heart out until we both left with our differing perspectives. 4 years down the line, I understand, acknowledge and admire that thought.No matter what, the only thing that will take precedence is the people around you. No amount of money or power or time can replace the amazing people you could surround yourself with, both personally as well as professionally.And that is what changed how I keep in touch with the people in my life. My circle is small, my circle is close. I no longer use the popular social media platforms to get likes from strangers or post stories for 3000 followers to see.You either belong in my limited contact list with every detail about you or we are not close enough.Building this platform is an attempt to better help me stay connected with the people I care about... and hopefully there are others who will want to get rid of endless scrolling of influencer's posts to replace it with a meaningful contact list.

No complicated settings, no need to create a website and no need to connect payment systems. It\\'s simple: Register, click on \"Create Course\" and all you have to do is fill the course with the knowledge you want to share with your students! Story: I previously taught physics as a tutor and together with a mathematician friend, we created an online school where we taught in a course format to small groups of students and started inviting other teachers to join the team. And then we came across the fact that teaching online using just video call services becomes extremely inconvenient when there are too many students and teachers. We started to explore programs, some were quite convenient and affordable, but allowed only to upload recordings of lessons, not to conduct live lessons. Others were either too complicated and expensive or on the contrary did not have the necessary functions. So the idea of creating our own platform was born - simple for the teacher and yet allowing everything you need for online teaching. Key features We are now focused on making the platform simple but with everything needed: Creating courses and lessons - You can divide lessons into modules and specify in each lesson its topic to structure the course. You can immediately upload a video to a lesson or choose time for a live lesson. Homework - Just add the exercises you need once and then you can quickly create homework for different lessons and courses in a few clicks. And if you choose to share added exercises, you\\'ll have access to exercises shared by other teachers! Sales - Students in their app can select courses and buy them as a whole or single lessons to try the course before buying or just to learn the topic they need right now, so your courses will be more trusted by students and their parents and get more sales. Next Steps We\\'d love your feedback, because it will help us understand how easy the platform is to use and what features you think are missing. Feel free to share your ideas with us in the comments or email maksim@subschool.us. Our next goal is to automate maximum routine teacher tasks and make students’ experience more engaging: We plan to make automatic generation of homework for students based on their performance. This way you will save time and students will get motivating assignments, more challenging ones for those who are bored to choose answers and more simple ones for those who are intimidated by long and complicated tasks. We will make chats and one-to-one tutoring features so that a teacher can combine online courses for groups and 1:1 lessons as a tutor all within one platform For courses that aim to prepare for exams we will apply a special rating system, based on incoming and outgoing generated tests, so the rating will reflect the effectiveness and motivate the most talented teachers.',\n",

There are various libraries out there that handle syntax highlighting, but then you realize that you need more than just syntax highlighting. If you are writing a technical blog or documentation, chances are you need features like line numbers, line highlighting, word highlighting and so on. Most of the syntax highlighting libraries don't come with this out-of-the-box, so you have to spend time implementing all this by yourself. Or if they do come with these features, it's incredibly hard to extend and style them according to the way you want it to be.React Code Block solves all these problems by only providing you with the core functionality without any of the styling. You can compose the primitive components from this library to build any kind of code block you need.\",\n",

Movie choice becomes a refined experience thanks to the careful collection of data that enables people to make educated choices. Its clever \"Tomatometer\" grading system is one of Rotten Tomatoes\\' defining characteristics. This unique method combines reviews from periodicals and expert film reviewers, reducing their evaluations to a single percentage. This \"Tomatometer\" rating is a quick indicator of a movie\\'s critical response and gives a quick glimpse into how well-liked it is generally among reviewers. Through their scores, Rotten Tomatoes amplifies the voice of the audience outside the domain of professional judgment. The platform creates a comprehensive understanding of a film\\'s resonance by allowing regular audiences to share their thoughts. This two-pronged approach fills the gap between critical evaluation and popular opinion, providing a thorough picture of a film\\'s influence.',\n",

       "  'description': 'Crime against women in India has been a significant issue, with various forms of violence and discrimination reported across the country. Women face a wide range of challenges, including domestic violence, sexual assault, dowry-related crimes, human trafficking, and other forms of gender-based violence. Here is an overview of some of the major types of crimes against women in India:1. Domestic Violence: Domestic violence is prevalent in many households in India, where women often face physical, emotional, and psychological abuse from their spouses or other family members. The Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act was enacted in 2005 to address this issue and provide legal protection to women facing domestic violence.2. Sexual Assault and Rape: Sexual assault and rape cases have been a matter of great concern in India. High-profile incidents, such as the 2012 Delhi gang-rape case, brought international attention to the issue. There have been efforts to strengthen laws and improve legal processes to address sexual crimes against women.3. Dowry Deaths: Dowry is a longstanding social issue in India, where brides may face harassment or violence from their in-laws or husbands if the dowry is perceived as insufficient. Dowry-related deaths or suicides are reported in some cases.4. Human Trafficking: Women and girls are often victims of human trafficking for various purposes, including sexual exploitation and forced labor. Trafficking networks operate both domestically and across borders.5. Honor Killings: Honor killings, though less common, still occur in some parts of India. Women who marry against the wishes of their families or engage in relationships deemed socially unacceptable may face violence or death as a result of so-called \"honor\" considerations.6. Acid Attacks: Acid attacks on women, often carried out as acts of revenge or to disfigure victims, have been reported in various parts of the country.7. Child Marriage: Despite legal provisions, child marriage is still practiced in some regions, leading to early and forced marriages of young girls, which can have adverse effects on their health and well-being.The Indian government has taken various measures to address crimes against women, including enacting stringent laws, establishing fast-track courts for swift justice, and implementing awareness campaigns to change societal attitudes. The \"Nirbhaya Fund\" was also created to support initiatives aimed at enhancing the safety and security of women in India.However, challenges persist in effectively combating crime against women, including issues related to reporting, social stigma, and systemic gaps. Continued efforts are essential to create a safer environment and ensure the protection and empowerment of women in India.',\n",

       "  'description': \"CoinAPI, established in 2017, has evolved from a personal project by CEO Artur Pietrzyk into a leading platform in the cryptocurrency data industry. Initially, Artur used the technology for high-frequency market-making in lesser-known crypto markets. Frustrated by the challenges of interacting with multiple exchanges, he pivoted his focus and launched CoinAPI's first product: the Market Data API. This API provided a unified, reliable, and fast way to access real-time and historical data from various cryptocurrency markets, collecting up to 200GB of compressed data daily.However, CoinAPI is not just about market data anymore. The company aims to move beyond the perception that it solely offers Market Data API. With the crypto market's rapid growth, CoinAPI aims to create a comprehensive portfolio of dedicated APIs for the cryptocurrency market and potentially for traditional currency markets in the future. One of the newest products is EMS Trading API. EMS API, or the trading API, allows trading on various exchanges. Unlike Market Data API, which generates data, EMS API enables operations and only generates data about executed operations. It is sold in two models: managed cloud and self-hosted. The managed cloud is easier to use, while self-hosted allows users to run the API on their infrastructure, keeping their trading activities private. EMS API connects to exchange APIs and allows operations like adding orders, providing a unified interface for managing multiple accounts.In summary, CoinAPI has grown from a hobbyist project into a comprehensive platform for cryptocurrency data. With a diverse product portfolio that now includes Node-as-a-Service and a commitment to innovation, CoinAPI aims to be the go-to solution for all cryptocurrency data needs, whether for trading, analytics, or development.If you would like to read more about EMS Trading API, we have created the ultimate guide to EMS Trading API on our blog. \",\n",

Additionally, there is a need for a secure and privacy-centric approach to handling sensitive patient data during the diagnostic process. The key points of the problem statement are as follows:MRI scans are currently used to diagnose brain tumors, but this process often involves manual analysis by medical professionals, which can be time-consuming and prone to errors. Additionally, patient data must be handled securely and privately during the diagnostic process. The problem statement can be summarized as follows:Manual MRI Analysis: Current methods rely heavily on manual analysis, which can cause delays in diagnosis and treatment planning.Accuracy and Efficiency: Early detection and timely intervention are crucial for patient outcomes and survival rates, so there is a need for a more accurate and efficient tumor identification process.Lack of Comprehensive Information: Patients often receive limited information about their brain tumor, which can hinder informed decision-making. Providing comprehensive insights is essential for patient empowerment.Data Privacy Concerns: Patient data, including MRI scans, must be handled securely and not stored for privacy reasons.Streamlining Appointment Booking: Appointment booking can be cumbersome and inefficient. An integrated system that facilitates seamless scheduling and communication is essential for patient convenience.Solution: In light of these challenges, OncoMRI aims to create an intelligent and privacy-focused solution that revolutionizes brain tumor diagnosis using AI-driven analysis. By leveraging the power of Azure Custom Vision, the application seeks to empower patients with comprehensive tumor insights and personalized treatment recommendations, ultimately contributing to improved patient outcomes and enhanced brain health care.OncoMRI is an innovative medical software application designed to revolutionize brain tumor diagnosis through AI-driven MRI analysis.Leveraging Azure Custom Vision's pre-trained machine learning model, the app accurately identifies Meningioma, Glioma, and Pituitary tumors from uploaded MRI scans.The platform ensures privacy by not storing any user data or MRI scans, safeguarding sensitive medical information through Streamlit.With a user-friendly interface built using Streamlit, patients can easily upload MRI scans and receive rapid and precise tumor identification results.Detailed insights about the detected tumor, including its characteristics, causes, effects, and potential treatments, are provided to enable informed decision-making.Personalized treatment recommendations based on the tumor type and stage empower patients to make the best healthcare choices.OncoMRI streamlines appointment booking with specialized doctors through its integrated Azure Logic App, facilitating seamless communication.The app's focus on data privacy, accuracy, and efficiency contributes to early detection and timely intervention, improving patient outcomes and brain health care.Tech Stack:The following tech stacks have been used to create the application and deploy it.Python to build the application.Streamlit to create a responsive web application along with widgets.Streamlit Community Cloud to deploy the web application for anyone across the globe to access it.Microsoft Azure AI Custom Vision to get a computer vision model trained using our dataset and use it to predict the tumor type with the patient's MRI scan.Microsoft Azure Logic App to send emails to the patient, doctor on appointment booking.GitHub to host the source code, use the version control (collaboration history), pull requests and GitHub collaboration features to build efficiently with the teammates.

       "  'description': 'The project at hand revolves around the creation of a podcast script centered on the world of sports, with a specific focus on the legendary footballer Lionel Messi. The endeavor unfolds in several key stages. It commences with the extraction of pertinent information from Wikipedia articles using Python libraries. Once the data is in hand, it undergoes preprocessing, where the extensive text is divided into more manageable chunks, each containing no more than 2500 tokens, ensuring compatibility with language models like GPT-3.5 Turbo.Following data segmentation, the project delves into data summarization. Leveraging OpenAI\\'s language model, the objective is to distill the wealth of information into a concise and engaging summary, highlighting key themes, facts, and highlights relevant to the overarching topic of \"Sports.\" This summary serves as the foundation for crafting an engaging podcast script.The podcast script, designed for an episode named \"Sport 101,\" takes shape with a conversational format. It features two distinct speakers, \"Tom\" and \"Jerry,\" who engage in an informative and casual discussion. The script is meticulously crafted, beginning with an introduction to the topic and extending to the podcast\\'s conclusion, complete with gratitude for the listeners. Additionally, the code explores the incorporation of voices from ElevenLabs to give life to the script, selecting specific speakers to match the context and tone.In summary, this project demonstrates the seamless synergy of technology, creativity, and linguistic prowess to produce a captivating and informative podcast script, embodying the essence of the sports world and the extraordinary career of Lionel Messi. It showcases the power of language models and data processing techniques in content creation, paving the way for innovative applications in the realm of podcasting and beyond.',\n",

       "  'description': \"Why yet another note-taking app?I have been a user of markdown based note-taking apps like obsidian for quite some time. What I found lacking in such apps was that they were too text heavy.My notes don't just contain text; they are usually a mixture of text, some images, code and diagrams. Therefore, a typical note I write is composed of a markdown text file with some images, link to some github gists, code sandboxes and screenshots of some hand-drawn diagrams. As a result, My note-taking experience was divided across several apps - I used to write markdown using obsidian, draw diagrams using tldraw and store their screenshots, write code in a Codesandbox and store it in markdown using a link. Aside from that if you have ever read Eloquent Javascript , you'll know how much being able to edit and run code right inside the browser while studying some programming concept helps in understanding. I wanted that type of experience from my note-taking app, where I or the reader of my note can tinker with code written in the note to get a grasp of the concepts quickly.How Notedown solves thisIn Notedown, you can:Write notes using a web-based markdown editor. The markdown code blocks get converted to a full fledged code-editor with syntax highlighting, autocompletion, linting and vim mode. The code inside the code blocks can be edited and run right inside the browser. You can execute javascript, typescript, rust, python and go code inside these code blocks.Embed a tldraw component right inside your markdown. The diagrams you draw will be converted to a crisp SVG on preview.Embed a code sandbox inside your markdown notes with a code-editor and web preview. If you have read any of Josh Comeau's blogs, you'll know what I'm talking about.Easily add Images from local filesystem. The thing I love above obsidian is that it's a local first app. I have emulated that philosophy in Notedown too. It is an entirely local-first app i.e. all your markdown text, images, tldraw drawings, code-sandboxes aren't uploaded anywhere unless you choose to. Everything is stored in the Index storage of your browser. You only need to upload a note if you want to sync it across devices. The note you upload remains in private mode by default, which means only you can view the note using the note's URL on any browser or device. You can choose to publish a note if you want to get a publicly shareable link for your note which can be accessed by everyone.All your notes will be organized using the tags you provide in the frontmatter of the markdown. The tags will loosely act as a folder giving a clean overview of note-collection. Because of the local-first nature of the app, searching through your notes is lightning fast.The app is entirely open-source:Nextjs App - https://github.com/Abhimanyu08/NotedownRemote Code execution server - https://github.com/Abhimanyu08/Notedown-rce-serverI'll add instructions to set it up locally shortly. You can file bugs on the github repo (https://github.com/Abhimanyu08/Notedown/issues) or message them to me on twitter (https://twitter.com/A_Bhimany_u) or telegram (a_bhiman)Roadmap aheadSupport more languagesMake it responsive. The app currently only works on desktops.Add multiple themes and allow a user greater control over the looks of his/her notebook.Talk to your notes using GPT along with semantic search.Add text-to-diagram support using mermaid.js\",\n",

There are two approaches to achieve this:Static ThemingThemes and colors are directly specified in the code.Changes are made based on some predefined logic.Dynamic ThemingThemes and colors are specified on the server side.Your application receives these values through APIs.With the consideration that theme values (colors) will be stored on server. I have implemented this -   First, I have created a CSS variable with some default value, and I am using that variable in my style (tailwind.config) to define my primary color. Later I am using the document object from javascript to update the value of CSS variable to change my primary color thorughout the appCheckout repository for details - https://github.com/Prasad-Katkade/nextjs-admin-dashboard (Give  if you liked explanation)\",\n",

This results in enhanced application responsiveness and optimized performance.Redis Backend: The package provides a Redis backend for efficient data storage and retrieval. Redis is configured to act as an LRU cache, ensuring that recently used data is prioritized for quick access.Automatic Cache Invalidation: The package incorporates Redis Keyspace Notifications to enable automatic cache invalidation across multiple instances. This ensures that changes or deletions made in one instance are promptly reflected in others.Event Listening: Instances using the package listen to Redis channels for key-related events, such as deletion, expiration, and eviction. This allows for real-time adjustments in local caches, maintaining data consistency.Configurability: The package offers various configuration options, including Time-To-Live (TTL) settings for both in-memory and Redis caches, allowing developers to fine-tune cache behavior based on their specific requirements.Compression Support: Data stored in Redis is compressed, reducing storage requirements and enhancing overall efficiency. Developers can also implement custom compression algorithms if needed.Key and Value Serializers: To accommodate custom data types, the package supports key and value serializers, providing flexibility in handling diverse data structures.',\n",

       "  'description': \"CrossPlay: Revolutionizing Web3 GamingThe Problem It SolvesIn the evolving landscape of web3 gaming, players are often confined within the boundaries of their respective blockchain platforms. This fragmentation leads to several challenges:Limited Interactions: Players on different blockchains cannot interact, compete, or share experiences, leading to a siloed and less social gaming environment.Restricted Game Access: Exclusive games on specific blockchains limit players' access to diverse gaming content.Diluted User Base: With a growing but still nascent user base in web3, the division across multiple chains further dilutes and segments the gaming community.Complex User Experience: Navigating across different blockchains for various games can be technically challenging and intimidating for new users.What CrossPlay OffersCrossPlay addresses these issues by creating a unified gaming platform that connects different blockchain networks. Here’s how it enhances the gaming experience: Cross-Chain Play: Gamers on platforms like Polygon can directly play with users on Celo, and vice versa. This feature dramatically expands the gaming community, allowing for richer interactions and competitions. Easy Access to Diverse Games: Players have access to a wider range of games without the need to switch blockchains or manage multiple wallets and currencies. Simplified User Experience: CrossPlay offers a streamlined, user-friendly interface that abstracts the complexities of cross-chain interactions, making it easier for both seasoned gamers and newcomers to jump into the action.\",\n",

To enhance the call-to-action (CTA) and underscore a sense of security, I integrated a vibrant Neon Green color.

That's it, it's really that simple. Emails are overwhelming. Most of us receive tens or hundreds of emails a day. Notifications, sales, newsletters, and more! We only need to see most of these emails once, and never open them again, leaving them as our digital dust bunnies accumulating in the corner of our inbox. Eventually, you have to sweep this digital dust or suffer the consequences: pay for more email storage, or spend your own time deleting old emails. The other cost is environmental. A single email has an average carbon dioxide equivalent of 0.3g. If the email has an image or other attachment, the carbon equivalent could be 50g (or higher). With the large number of users with email on this planet, Berners-Lee estimates that email could account for 0.3% of the world's carbon footprint. Mail Sweeper is designed to help you save time, money, and the environment. We could have made this product a subscription, but we didn't. A one time payment and the product is yours. Forever. (unless you want to uninstall it, but we hope you don't!) What about privacy? We're big privacy advocates. Mail Sweeper never stores or reads your emails.

Users can access a curated set of coding questions, solve them individually, or seek assistance from their peers. When a user clicks \"Connect with Peer,\" a push notification is sent to all web devices, allowing available individuals to join and provide assistance in real-time. Codeably supports a wide array of features, including video calls, audio calls, live cursor tracking, member location identification, component locking, and avatars. Users can also earn stars as a reward for their participation and contributions.How we built itCodeably was built using a combination of modern technologies, including Ably and Ably Spaces for real-time communication and synchronization. We leveraged Node JS, React JS, and WebRTC to support features like video calls and audio calls. The coding challenges and questions are stored with MongoDB and managed efficiently, ensuring a seamless experience for users. Our development team worked meticulously to create a user-friendly interface that integrates all these functionalities seamlessly.Challenges we ran intoThe development of Codeably posed several challenges. Ensuring a real-time and seamless experience, even with a large number of concurrent users, required rigorous optimization. Integrating video calls, audio calls, and live cursor tracking while maintaining performance was another significant challenge. We also worked on refining the user experience to make it both accessible and user-friendly, considering the diverse coding backgrounds of our users.Accomplishments that we\\'re proud ofWe take pride in several accomplishments. Creating a real-time coding collaboration platform that effectively supports video and audio calls, as well as collaborative coding, is a remarkable achievement. Our team worked tirelessly to ensure that Codeably is not only feature-rich but also user-centric, providing an enriching learning and collaborative experience for all users. We\\'re also proud of seamlessly integrating Ably and Ably Spaces to enhance the real-time capabilities of our platform.What we learnedThroughout the development of Codeably, we gained valuable insights into the power of real-time collaboration in coding education. We learned how to manage complex interactions, optimize performance, and create an engaging platform for learning and collaboration. Additionally, our team deepened their understanding of Ably\\'s capabilities, particularly in real-time communication and synchronization.What\\'s next for CODEABLyThe journey continues for Codeably, with plans to expand and enhance its features. We aim to add more coding challenges and questions, create a more extensive and diverse community of users, and further improve the user experience. We will listen to user feedback and continue refining the platform based on their needs. Our vision is to make Codeably the ultimate destination for collaborative coding, learning, and mentorship, where users can unlock their full coding potential while helping others do the same.Directions to UseYou must click on \"Connect to Peer\" to start with ably spaces.You must terminate the session once you have initiated it to update the real-time status.A person must be in a valid space to have video call initialization.No information about guest users will be saved.',\n",

Need to remember where you had them and then edit lists, manually checking if links still work...  Share with others? Ever found yourself sharing a bunch of links for what you're picking up to buy?  Dinosave is a single place to keep all your product bookmarks and whole wishlists. Inspired by some of the best-in-class apps for saving: pinterest, mymind, savee, cosmos.so and others and built Dinosave to focus on e-commerce products. We were surprised no big company has tried yet to solve the issue but even if they did you’d have to give up your data and would have drown in offers and confusing, bloated UI. Our main features:  Completely free and we don't sell your data, no ads, no deals, no spam from stores.  Track real price drops on all of the websites Dinosave works with.  Organize saved products, similarly to Pinterest.  Share your wishlist link with anyone, anywhere. A few use cases:  Compare styles across different brands, collect looks with items from different stores in a single place.  Collect holiday decor and more to then share with your family and friends.  Gather or compare gear for a new hobby.  Use it as pinterest that you can actually reliably shop. What's for Dino on the horizon?  Web and mobile apps to add, view and manage your saved products.  Some exciting social features like seeing other people’s wishlists who saved the same item as you did and more  Fostering community for faster feedback loops while we're developing and growing up Dinosave We've sweat a lot of details to make it a nice experience and hope you'll enjoy interacting with Dino.\",\n",

       "  'description': 'This case study outlines my process for designing an app that helps designers to browse & read product reviews from other designers & be part of the design community in the same platform.Problem StatementDesigners often have a problem in finding, reading as well as writing Product Reviews especially since there are no dedicated product review apps. Reviews from the general users are available in plenty but the need to have specific Designer reviews to make sound decisions on the product’s UI/UX updates has been missing so far.SolutionA product review app designed specifically for designers would provide a valuable resource for finding & reading product reviews. The app would be easy to use & would include features that are meant for product designers, such as the ability to write reviews, read reviews from others fellow designers & be part of the community of Designers as a whole.This is where DesignersBox comes in. It enables the designers to write reviews for products, provide ratings based on their experiences with the UI & UX of the App as well as checkout reviews from other designers all while being part of a large community of designers helping each other learn, Collab & grow in their careers.Goals• Increased Productivity — Designers would be able to find the information they need more quickly & easily, which would save them time.• Understand Designer’s Mindset — Product Designers will be able to understand the mindset of the designer’s reviewing the products, it’ll help the up & coming designers as well as the experienced ones to make sound decisions while designing or updating their own products.• Community of Designers — Being part of a community of designers from across the globe will be able to help them to learn, grow & collaborate to excel in their respective careers as Designers.',\n",

       "  'description': 'Hey Guys! My name is Dmitry, and this is my first experience like this, so don\\'t insult me I\\'ve done a lot of products before that failed and also made a lot of mistakes over the past 10 years. The idea for this product came to us when we had an agency where we had big ambitions and a good start, but after 6 years, we were stuck and needed help understanding why we couldn\\'t grow more. You may assume that starting a business is more complex than many guys said, and every new day is a new challenge, so sometimes you may want help to resolve hard challenges and grow faster than your competitors. That\\'s why having such a platform would be nice, where you can ask people who already did this how to do better.So Shortly, the Product Should Help Businesses (Entrepreneurs) and Individuals Find Experts to Grow Their Professional Skills.\\xa0In our fantasies, we would like to grow to the top, where people from different places around the world could find Tier specialists and entrepreneurs. Like, we want to give any person a chance to talk to anybody from Google or Nvidia, etc., and ask them questions. We understand that if you want to talk with guys from Top Tier companies, this would not be free, so their time would cost some money.\\xa0Initially, we started with small pieces to build this platform but shortly realized that to build such, there should be a lot of things communicating between each other to give users a great experience. I\\'ve brought the most challenging to build in the list: Flexible search to find and filter experts(category, sub-category, skills, language, rating, verification, and more) The planner page is where you can see all the events that come to you or you made. This is one of the hardest features here; we did a lot of complex communications to build this page where, as a consultant, you want to see all your meetings with a calendar or list. Video calls and their recording. After all the time you and the expert spend together, you may want to have a video recording to show it to your growing team department. Book a call. Oh, this was interesting; you may think about it this way..when you are going on a call with an expert, you may want to ask him straightforward questions so both of you will understand the context and will not talk about \"weather\" all the time. Also, if you are an expert, you may want to have only some specific time to have a book, like every Friday from 5pm. Yeah, so we build our own internal framework to handle such complex cases, see for yourself! System where experts can flexibly create their own custom services to provide. Including but not forcing them to select for whom they want to provide a service for individuals or for businesses only. When creating a service, they can select what questions the requester needs to answer, when the expert wants to have consultations, etc. If I create a successful business owner in my career, and I may want to mentor someone, I don\\'t have all day to do this, and definitely, I want to understand before even a call if I can help this person with his questions. \\xa0 Notifications, Profile, Book Detail, etc.\\xa0Best Regards, Dmytro.',\n",

GradeAssist solves that by using Al to analyze a student's work to provide a suggested grade and a breakdown of the rubric's criteria, with instant copy-paste feedback.One of my teachers had to grade 120 pages in 1 day for exams and it made me realize that there's an awesome tool like Scantron for multiple choice - but no equivalent for written assessments.GradeAssist is a tool meant to help teachers save time grading and reduce bias - not replace professional judgement. It helps eliminate factors like mental exhaustion, biases towards students, and disparities in leniency amongst teachers that negatively impact students' academic experiences.What I've noticed by showing it to my peers is that students greatly benefit from it too. In fact one of my friends got a 90% on GradeAssist and later got his actual mark back from the teacher and got 91%. The accuracy allows students to predict their grades and get actionable feedback on how to improve.Would love to know what you guys think, whether you're a student or a teacher!\",\n",

       "  'description': \"There has been a lot of interest around FIRE (Financial Independence/Retire Early) lately. Even if one doesn't have much interest in retiring, having a sense of where you are in your financial independence journey is extremely important, as is the knowledge of how much would your savings last, or much more do you need, if you something happened to your job.There are a few calculators that exist for this already but most of them assume a lot of things, e.g:Inflation ratesReturn on investmentsYour needs in terms of inflow/outflow/goalsAnd most of them are looking to sell you something, thus are biased.I made this to be extremely flexible to account for almost any possibility. You can have multiple kinds of inflows and outflows of money.Some inflows or outflows may start or stop at different times (e.g. you have a side biz now that gets you some additional money but it grows at a different rate compared to your normal salary. Or you plan to have a passive income biz after you retire. Or maybe your expenses will change after you kids have their own jobs. All of these and more can be modeled)You can have many goals at different times, and all of them are impacted by different inflation rates (e.g. Education grows at 10%, while regular groceries at 7-8% and cars at 3-4%)You have different withdrawals going on for some time e.g. EMI paymentsYou are very privacy conscious so you want to store your data locally in the browser so no one can see it everE2E encryption built in: You are privacy conscious but want to share the data with someone else (because you want to show them your calculations, or you are doing it for someone else as a friend or financial advisor), you can generate sharing links while your data remains end to end encrypted.Collaborate: You can even collaborate with someone on the same model by sharing an editable link with them. When they make changes to it and generate the link again, the changes will be visible to anyone else with that editable or viewable linkMany more\",\n",

It is designed to make data migration and onboarding seamless. SmartParse results from our pain in dealing with data migration on every large-scale project and cloud migration over the last five years. On the surface, moving data from one system to another appears simple. In retrospect, it always takes longer and consumes more capacity, time, and energy.A Smart feature setData Quarantining: Prevent a few lines of bad data from ruining your entire import. SmartParse ring-fences the errored data and can be easily downloaded for re-evaluation and re-import.Built-in SFTP: No more managing SFTP servers and credentials for recurring data ingestion like daily recon and settlements, system syncing, and more.Scalability and Large File Support: SmartParse can seriously scale and handle file sizes that far exceed the shackles of normal server memory.Throughput management: Data migration as fast as you want and as slow as you need to not overwhelm those downstream systems.Turn-key Flat File Support: SmartParse supports flat files in all their flavors.Low-code: Our built-in editor with a host of utility functions makes mapping easy for even the non-coders.Some Beta users have seen speed increases of over 120x after years of struggling with brittle, unstable glue code and slow downstream systems.SmartParse is ideal for:Organizations or Individuals dealing with once-off data migrationsOrganizations with recurring data onboarding, e.g., continuous data syncing to new or legacy systems.Organizations and Individuals with Daily data ingestion like recon and settlementWith SmartParse, data transfer becomes not just manageable but effortless. We're continually enhancing our platform, adding new features, and refining user experience to cater to the evolving needs of our users.Sign up today at: https://smartparse.ioWhat problem is SmartParse solving?Building and maintaining data ingestion pipelines is more complex and costly than it appears. A few incorrect data entries can disrupt an entire system migration, while too much data too quickly may overload downstream systems. Transparent reporting and data migration KPIs are often overlooked. Additionally, configuring and maintaining SFTP servers for secure data transfer incurs significant costs and adds complexity. These challenges necessitate skilled, highly technical personnel, increasing the overall demands of the process.What is SmartParse's Unique Selling Point (USP)?SmartParse allows teams to reduce the time spent building and maintaining data ingestion pipelines from days or weeks to just minutes. It features built-in data quarantining to isolate problematic entries, downstream circuit breakers to safeguard critical systems, and transparent reporting for clear oversight. Additionally, SmartParse supports large files, offers low-code mapping and utilities, and includes built-in SFTP capabilities. These features mean that your teams do not require highly technical skills to manage these crucial yet complex parts of your business efficiently.How is SmartParse better than other existing alternatives?Large corporations typically rely on enterprise-priced integration platforms to manage their data integrations, which can be prohibitively expensive for smaller or budget-conscious businesses. These companies are often forced to outsource development or construct bespoke data integration solutions internally. SmartParse changes the game by making enterprise-level integration features accessible to organizations of any size. It streamlines and automates this critical business function, enabling all businesses, regardless of their size or budget, to efficiently manage their data integrations.\",\n",
